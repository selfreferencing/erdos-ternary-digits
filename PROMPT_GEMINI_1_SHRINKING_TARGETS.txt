GEMINI DEEP RESEARCH: Shrinking Targets and Borel-Cantelli for Rotations

RESEARCH QUESTION:
What is known about shrinking target problems for irrational rotations on the circle, specifically when the target is a fractal set like the Cantor set?

CONTEXT:
The Erdős ternary digits conjecture can be reformulated as: Does the orbit {n·α mod 1} (where α = log_3(2)) hit the ternary Cantor set C_3 only finitely often?

The target "shrinks" in the sense that we're interested in hitting the k-digit approximation C_3^(k), which has measure (2/3)^k.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO RESEARCH:

1. DYNAMICAL BOREL-CANTELLI LEMMAS
   - What are the standard Borel-Cantelli results for dynamical systems?
   - Which systems satisfy strong Borel-Cantelli (hitting shrinking targets)?
   - Do irrational rotations satisfy any form of dynamical BC?

2. SHRINKING TARGET PROPERTY (STP)
   - Define the Shrinking Target Property precisely
   - Which systems have STP? Which don't?
   - What's known for circle rotations specifically?
   - Papers by Tseng, Fayad, Kim on this topic

3. THE ROTATION OBSTRUCTION
   - Rotations are ergodic but NOT mixing
   - How does lack of mixing affect shrinking target results?
   - Are there negative results showing STP fails for rotations?

4. FRACTAL TARGETS
   - Standard STP results are for shrinking balls/intervals
   - What's known when the target is fractal (Cantor-like)?
   - Does the Fourier structure of the target matter?
   - Paper: "Rare events for Cantor target sets" (arXiv:1903.07200)

5. QUANTITATIVE BOUNDS
   - For rotations hitting shrinking intervals: what's the threshold?
   - Relationship to Diophantine properties of the rotation angle
   - What's known for badly approximable vs Liouville angles?

6. THE SPECIFIC CASE α = log_3(2)
   - Any results specifically about this irrational?
   - Is log_3(2) badly approximable? What are its continued fraction properties?
   - Does its transcendence help?

DELIVERABLE:
A comprehensive survey of shrinking target theory for rotations, with assessment of which results apply (or fail to apply) to the Erdős setting.
