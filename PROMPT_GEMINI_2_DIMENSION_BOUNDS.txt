GEMINI DEEP RESEARCH: Hausdorff Dimension Bounds for Erdős Exceptional Sets

RESEARCH QUESTION:
What are the best known Hausdorff dimension bounds for the exceptional set in the Erdős ternary digits problem, and what techniques produce them?

CONTEXT:
Lagarias reformulated the Erdős conjecture in terms of exceptional sets. Define:
- E(Z_3) = {λ ∈ Z_3 : the orbit λ·2^n hits the 3-adic Cantor set Σ_{3,2̄} infinitely often}

The conjecture is equivalent to: 1 ∉ E(Z_3), or more strongly, E(Z_3) = {0}.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO RESEARCH:

1. LAGARIAS'S ORIGINAL BOUNDS
   - Paper: arXiv:math/0512006
   - What's the dimension bound he proves?
   - What's the technique (nesting sets, subadditivity)?

2. ABRAM-BOLSHAKOV-LAGARIAS IMPROVEMENT
   - Paper: arXiv:1508.05967
   - Current best bound: dim(E) ≤ log_3(φ) ≈ 0.438
   - What's the "nesting constant" Γ?
   - How is the golden ratio φ involved?

3. AUTOMATA-THEORETIC METHODS
   - How are finite automata used to describe intersection sets?
   - The spectral radius approach to dimension
   - Why are these dimensions algebraic numbers?

4. PATH-SET FRACTALS
   - What are path-set fractals?
   - How does the automaton structure constrain dimension?
   - Can this be pushed to prove dim = 0?

5. INTERSECTION SETS
   - Structure of C(M_1, ..., M_k) = ∩ (1/M_i) Σ_{3,2̄}
   - Dimension bounds for multiple intersections
   - What happens as k → ∞?

6. THE GAP TO FINITENESS
   - Even dim = 0 doesn't immediately give finiteness
   - What additional argument would be needed?
   - Is there a "Lagarias Conjecture B" (dim = 0)?

7. RELATED DIMENSION RESULTS
   - Shmerkin's work on ×2,×3 intersections
   - Hochman's results on self-similar measures
   - Wu's dimension drop results

DELIVERABLE:
A technical survey of all dimension bounds for this problem, the techniques used, and what improvement would be needed to prove the conjecture.
