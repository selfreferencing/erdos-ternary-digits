GEMINI DEEP RESEARCH: Measure Rigidity and the ×2,×3 Problem

RESEARCH QUESTION:
How does measure rigidity theory (Furstenberg, Rudolph, Lindenstrauss) relate to the Erdős ternary digits conjecture?

CONTEXT:
The Erdős problem involves the interaction of base 2 (powers of 2) and base 3 (ternary digits). This is exactly the setting of Furstenberg's ×2,×3 conjecture about invariant measures.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO RESEARCH:

1. FURSTENBERG'S ×2,×3 CONJECTURE
   - Precise statement
   - Current status (what's proved, what's open)
   - Relationship to Erdős: Would a full proof of Furstenberg imply Erdős?

2. RUDOLPH'S THEOREM
   - Measures invariant under ×2 and ×3 with positive entropy
   - Why doesn't this immediately solve digit problems?

3. LINDENSTRAUSS'S WORK
   - Quantum unique ergodicity
   - Littlewood conjecture progress
   - Measure rigidity on homogeneous spaces
   - Any implications for digit problems?

4. THE SPECIFIC ORBIT PROBLEM
   - Rigidity results typically concern MEASURES, not single orbits
   - Is there a way to go from measure statements to orbit statements?
   - The "exceptional set" approach as a bridge

5. HOCHMAN-SHMERKIN RESULTS
   - Self-similar measures and dimension
   - Exact overlaps and algebraic numbers
   - Intersection of ×p and ×q invariant sets

6. JOHNSON'S THEOREM
   - Sets invariant under both ×2 and ×3
   - The only closed invariant sets are finite unions of orbits or the whole space
   - Does this help with Erdős?

7. QUANTITATIVE RIGIDITY
   - Any results quantifying how fast orbits become equidistributed?
   - "Finite-time" rigidity vs asymptotic rigidity
   - This would be the "log-time cancellation" we're looking for

8. CONDITIONAL IMPLICATIONS
   - Are there statements of form "If [rigidity result X] then Erdős holds"?
   - What's the minimal rigidity statement that would suffice?

DELIVERABLE:
A survey of measure rigidity as it relates to the ×2,×3 setting, with specific assessment of what can and cannot be extracted for the Erdős conjecture.
