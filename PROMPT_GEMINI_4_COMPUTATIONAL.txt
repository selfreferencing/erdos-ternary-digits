GEMINI DEEP RESEARCH: Computational Verification and Heuristics for Erdős

RESEARCH QUESTION:
What is known from computational experiments about the Erdős ternary digits conjecture, and what heuristics predict its truth?

CONTEXT:
The conjecture has been verified computationally to extremely large values. Understanding the computational evidence and the probabilistic heuristics gives insight into what a proof might need.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO RESEARCH:

1. SAYE'S VERIFICATION (2022)
   - Paper: Journal of Integer Sequences
   - Verified to n ≤ 2·3^45 ≈ 5.9×10^21
   - What algorithm was used?
   - What's the computational barrier to going further?
   - Any near-misses or interesting patterns found?

2. EARLIER COMPUTATIONS
   - History of computational verification
   - Who verified what, when?
   - Did any computations find unexpected structure?

3. THE PROBABILISTIC HEURISTIC
   - If ternary digits were random: P(no digit 2 in k digits) = (2/3)^k
   - Expected number of solutions: Σ (2/3)^{n·log_3(2)} ≈ Σ (0.77)^n < ∞
   - This predicts only finitely many solutions
   - How well does reality match the heuristic?

4. DIGIT FREQUENCY STATISTICS
   - Ren-Roettger (2025): arXiv:2511.03861
   - What's known about limiting frequencies of digits in 2^n?
   - Is equidistribution of digits provable or just observed?
   - Any anomalies in digit distribution?

5. PATTERNS IN SMALL CASES
   - n = 0: 2^0 = 1 = (1)_3
   - n = 2: 2^2 = 4 = (11)_3
   - n = 8: 2^8 = 256 = (100111)_3
   - Why these specific values? Any structural reason?
   - Is there a pattern that suggests why no more exist?

6. RELATED COMPUTATIONAL SEARCHES
   - Powers of 2 in other bases
   - Powers of other primes in base 3
   - What patterns emerge?

7. CLAIMED PROOFS
   - Spencer (Academia.edu): Claims proof via "carry-exclusion"
   - Any other claimed proofs?
   - Status of these claims (verified? rejected? unknown?)

8. WHAT COMPUTATION CANNOT SHOW
   - Even verifying to 10^100 wouldn't prove the conjecture
   - What's the theoretical barrier?
   - Could there be a very large counterexample?

DELIVERABLE:
A comprehensive survey of computational and heuristic evidence, with assessment of what we can and cannot conclude from it.
