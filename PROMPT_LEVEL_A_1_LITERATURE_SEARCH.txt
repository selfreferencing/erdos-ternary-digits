RESEARCH PROMPT: Direct Literature Search for Erdős Ternary Digits

RESEARCH TASK:
Conduct a comprehensive literature search for results related to the Erdős ternary digits conjecture.

SPECIFIC SEARCHES NEEDED:

1. THE CORE PROBLEM
   - Search for: "Erdős ternary digits conjecture"
   - Search for: "powers of 2 base 3 digit 2"
   - Search for: "2^n ternary expansion"
   - Find all papers directly addressing this conjecture

2. KEY AUTHORS TO INVESTIGATE
   - Jeffrey Lagarias (Michigan)
   - William Abram
   - Artem Bolshakov
   - Robert Saye (computational verification)
   - Vesselin Dimitrov
   - Roger Howe
   - Find their papers on this topic

3. RELATED CONJECTURES
   - Search for: "digit sum powers of 2"
   - Search for: "Gel'fond digit problems"
   - Search for: "normality of powers"
   - Find theorems about digit distribution in exponential sequences

4. 3-ADIC APPROACH
   - Search for Lagarias's papers on Z_3 formulation
   - Search for: "exceptional set dimension digit avoidance"
   - Search for: "path-set fractals"
   - Find the best dimension bounds

5. SHRINKING TARGETS / DYNAMICAL
   - Search for: "shrinking target irrational rotation"
   - Search for: "Borel-Cantelli rotations"
   - Search for: "hitting times Cantor set"
   - Find theorems about orbits hitting fractal targets

6. RECENT WORK (2020-2026)
   - Search arXiv for recent preprints
   - Check for any claimed proofs or major progress
   - Look for Ren-Roettger (2025) on digit frequencies

For each significant paper found, provide:
- Full citation
- Main result (theorem statement)
- Technique used
- How it relates to the Erdős conjecture
- What gap remains

Compile a bibliography organized by approach.
