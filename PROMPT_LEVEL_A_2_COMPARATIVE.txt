RESEARCH PROMPT: Comparative Analysis of Solved vs Unsolved Digit Problems

BACKGROUND:
The Erdős ternary digits conjecture remains open since 1979. I want to understand why by comparing it to similar problems that WERE solved.

RESEARCH TASK:
Find digit problems that share features with Erdős but have been resolved. Analyze what made them tractable.

1. SOLVED PROBLEMS TO INVESTIGATE

   a) Dimitrov-Howe (2021): "If 2^n in base 3 has ≤25 digit-1s, then n ∈ {0,2,8}"
      - Why does bounding the number of 1s make it tractable?
      - What's the proof technique?
      - Can it be extended?

   b) Stewart's S-unit theorem applications
      - What digit problems has it solved?
      - Why doesn't it solve Erdős?

   c) Mahler's work on digit problems
      - What did Mahler prove about digits of algebraic numbers?
      - Any techniques applicable here?

   d) Cobham's theorem (1969)
      - Sequences recognized by automata in two multiplicatively independent bases
      - Why doesn't this immediately solve Erdős?

   e) Any finiteness results for "digit avoidance" in exponential sequences
      - Are there ANY infinite exponential sequences proved to avoid a digit only finitely often?

2. STRUCTURAL COMPARISON

   For each solved problem, identify:
   - The finiteness mechanism (why are there only finitely many solutions?)
   - The counting mechanism (how do you bound the count?)
   - The explicit bound (can you compute it?)

   For Erdős, identify which mechanism is missing.

3. THE NEAREST UNSOLVED PROBLEMS

   Find other open problems of similar difficulty:
   - Normality of sqrt(2) in base 10
   - Gel'fond's problems on digit sums
   - Furstenberg's ×2,×3 conjecture

   Is Erdős easier or harder than these? Why?

4. NEGATIVE RESULTS

   Are there proofs that certain approaches CANNOT work?
   - Lower bounds on methods
   - Barriers like natural proofs or relativization
   - Results showing the problem is "hard" in some formal sense

Synthesize: What distinguishes solved from unsolved digit problems?
