RESEARCH PROMPT: Field Mapping for the Erdős Ternary Digits Problem

BACKGROUND:
The Erdős ternary digits conjecture (1979): Every sufficiently large 2^n contains digit 2 in base 3.

The problem involves the orbit {n·log_3(2) mod 1} and whether it hits a fractal target (the ternary Cantor set C_3 or its logarithmic image) finitely or infinitely often.

RESEARCH TASK:
I need to identify which mathematical fields and subfields are most relevant to this problem. For each field, identify:

1. ERGODIC THEORY / DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS
   - Shrinking target problems
   - Borel-Cantelli lemmas for dynamical systems
   - Mixing vs non-mixing systems
   - What's the state of shrinking target theory for irrational rotations?

2. DIOPHANTINE APPROXIMATION
   - Properties of log_3(2) as an irrational number
   - Badly approximable numbers
   - Schmidt games and winning sets
   - How do Diophantine properties of α affect orbit behavior?

3. FRACTAL GEOMETRY / HAUSDORFF DIMENSION
   - Dimension of exceptional sets
   - Intersection theory for Cantor sets
   - What dimension bounds exist for this problem?

4. p-ADIC ANALYSIS
   - 3-adic formulation of the problem
   - ×2 dynamics on Z_3
   - Exceptional sets in p-adic setting

5. AUTOMATA THEORY / SYMBOLIC DYNAMICS
   - Digit sequences and finite automata
   - Cobham's theorem and base dependence
   - Path-set fractals

For each field, provide:
- Key papers and authors working on related problems
- The specific tools or theorems that might apply
- Known limitations or reasons why standard techniques fail
- Open problems in that field that would imply progress on Erdős

Which field is most likely to yield the breakthrough?
