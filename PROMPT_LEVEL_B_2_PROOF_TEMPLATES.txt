RESEARCH PROMPT: Proof Template Analysis for Erdős Ternary Digits

BACKGROUND:
The Erdős ternary digits conjecture (1979): The only n with 2^n having no digit 2 in base 3 are n = 0, 2, 8.

I want to understand what a proof of this conjecture would look like structurally.

RESEARCH TASK:
Analyze proofs of "nearby" theorems - results that share structural features with Erdős but were actually proved. For each, extract the proof template.

1. SUBSPACE THEOREM APPLICATIONS
   - Schmidt's Subspace Theorem
   - S-unit equations
   - Dimitrov-Howe's "≤25 ones" result uses this approach
   - What's the template? Why does it work for bounded digit count but not unbounded?

2. TRANSCENDENCE / ALGEBRAIC INDEPENDENCE
   - Baker's theorem on linear forms in logarithms
   - Gel'fond-Schneider theorem
   - Does log_3(2) being transcendental help?

3. MEASURE RIGIDITY PROOFS
   - Furstenberg's ×2,×3 conjecture (partial results)
   - Rudolph's theorem
   - Lindenstrauss-Kleinbock-Margulis on homogeneous dynamics
   - What's the template for "×p and ×q have no common structure"?

4. COMBINATORIAL / COVERING ARGUMENTS
   - Covering systems for digit problems
   - Sieve methods
   - What combinatorial structure would force digit 2 to appear?

5. AUTOMATA-THEORETIC PROOFS
   - Cobham's theorem proof structure
   - How do you prove a sequence is NOT automatic?
   - Path-set emptiness arguments

For each template, assess:
- What input does it require?
- What does it output?
- Why does it fail for the full Erdős conjecture?
- What modification might make it work?

Identify the proof template most likely to succeed for Erdős.
